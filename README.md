# Hello-World
A new starter.
I can be very hyper at times. Filled with a wide range of mental issues and whatnot but I function just fine. I'm quite friendly and easy to get along with. I have patience when it is needed but I have a short temper. (Outside of when patience is needed). I calm down fast, though. So that's good! I.. think. XD Anyway, I just enjoy new things so I'm giving this a go. It interests me.
